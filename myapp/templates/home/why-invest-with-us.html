                            <p>This may in part be caused by exchange rate variations where overseas investments are
                                held. Investors are advised to consider carefully the special risks of investing in
                                emerging market securities. Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher
                                risk and potentially more volatile than those in more established markets.</p>

                            <p>Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you
                                should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.</p>
                            <p>Some investments have a fixed term or may not be accessible until you reach your
                                retirement age. For products with a fixed term you may get back significantly less than
                                originally invested if you make an early withdrawal.</p>
