						<p>The introduction of the Monthly Maximum Charge will not affect any charging period that ended prior to 1st August 2017. Any notification of charges that are generated on or after 1st August 2017 will incorporate the new Monthly Maximum Charge cap.</p>
						<p>Further details, including the level of the monthly cap applicable to each account, can be found in the more details section below. </p>
						<p>If you make more than one payment on the same day we take this as one overdraft request and only charge one fee. You cannot apply for an overdraft on Basic Ever green trust co Bank  Account (or any savings accounts).</p>
						<p>There are no overdraft usage fees on Premier Ever green trust co Bank  Account, Student Ever green trust co Bank  Accounts or Ever green trust co Bank  Account Pay Monthly.</p>

								<h3>Agreeing an overdraft limit in advance</h3>
								<p>An arranged request occurs when you approach us to arrange an overdraft limit.</p>
								<p>There is no overdraft fee for agreeing an arranged limit and it gives you greater control of your finances â you'll have an agreed limit within which you know items will be paid without incurring any overdraft fees. It's important to choose an adequate limit because if you go over it you may be charged daily overdraft usage fees, see our <a href="#">Charges and Additional Product Terms</a> (PDF) for full details.</p>
								<p>Your overdraft limit will be agreed until further notice, we will review the facility annually and contact you if we will be making any changes.</p>
								
								<h3>Going overdrawn without agreeing it in advance</h3>
								<p>An unarranged request is when you authorise a payment that would take your account overdrawn or beyond your arranged limit without agreeing in advance an overdraft to cover it.</p>
								<p>We will always consider an unarranged request and will make the payment if we can, subject to status. If approved the overdraft will be provided for 31 days to cover the item concerned.</p>

								<h3>Unarranged overdraft usage fees - and how to avoid them</h3>
								<p>If your overdraft limit is adequate and you don't go above it, all you need pay is the overdraft interest. We only charge a daily unarranged overdraft usage fee if you are more than Â£10 in your unarranged overdraft, see <a href="#">Charges and Additional Product Terms</a> (PDF) for full details.</p>
								<p>We will always try to make your payments even if you do not have sufficient cleared funds in your account and the payment would take you over any arranged overdraft facility.</p>
								<p>Remember, it's more cost effective to arrange an adequate arranged overdraft than rely on unarranged overdrafts.</p>

								<h3>How you can keep track of your balance</h3>
								<p>To try to help you avoid overdraft fees, we will send you overdraft text alerts if we've agreed an unarranged overdraft on your account. We will also send you a text alert if there isn't sufficient cleared funds available, in your account, to make a payment. You can opt out of receiving these text messages by calling us.</p>

								<p>There are also several other ways you can keep an eye on where your balance is in relation to your overdraft limit:</p>

								<ul>
									<li><span class="firstspan"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></span><span class="secondspan">Text message alerts sent to your mobile at no extra cost â you can set these up via online banking or by calling us on +1 (000) 000-0000 </span></li>

									<li><span class="firstspan"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></span><span class="secondspan">The <a href="#">Ever green trust co Bank  UK Mobile Banking app</a></span></li>

									<li><span class="firstspan"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></span><span class="secondspan">Ever green trust co Bank  cash machines will warn you if you try to make a withdrawal that might result in you being charged</span></li>

									<li><span class="firstspan"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></span><span class="secondspan">Online banking to view balances, statements and payment details - plus increase (subject to status), decrease or cancel your overdraft limit.</span></li>

									<li><span class="firstspan"><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></span><span class="secondspan">Our automated service on +1 (000) 000-0000  any time of the day or night to check your balance</span></li>
								</ul>

								<h3>The cost of your overdraft</h3>
								<p>If you keep within your arranged overdraft limit the only cost you need pay is interest. Here are the rates that apply to overdrafts on our accounts, at a glance.</p>

							<p>In order to reach the monthly maximum charge limit, based on current interest rates, you'd have to be over your arranged overdraft limit by more than Â£50,000 for Ever green trust co Bank  Premier and Â£230,000 for Jade by Ever green trust co Bank  Premier for a full charging month.</p>
							<p><sup>3</sup> We'll charge overdraft interest on any arranged and unarranged overdraft balances but no overdraft fees.<br>* EAR (Effective Annual Rate) takes account of the interest rate and how often interest is charged, and does not include any other fees or charges.</p>
							<p>There are various scenarios in which you may be charged a daily unarranged overdraft usage fee. To know more about the situations in which you may be charged, please see these <a href="#" target="_self">examples of charges</a></p>
							<p>For details of the charges that may be applicable, please click here to see the relevant Charges and <a href="#">Additional Product Terms</a> (PDF).</p>
							<h3>Account Management Service</h3>
							<p>Every month we will review your account to make sure your overdraft borrowing is suitable, based on your salary or other income. If we feel that your overdraft borrowing may be too much compared to your income, we will contact you to let you know an appropriate amount to pay in. We will also explain how we may be able to help, in the short and long term, if you are unable to pay in this amount.</p>
							<h3>How is Ever green trust co Bank  Account Pay Monthly different?</h3>
							<p>Ever green trust co Bank  Account Pay Monthly was specially introduced to help customers keep a firmer grip on their account.</p>
							<p>You can request an arranged overdraft facility. You can request an arranged overdraft limit, but whether you have an arranged overdraft limit or not, we'll also provide you with an automatic Â£50 overdraft buffer on top as a safety net. We'll charge overdraft interest on any arranged overdraft balance, but we wont charge for use of the Â£50 buffer (effective from 1 August 2017).</p>
							<p>The key difference with Ever green trust co Bank  Account Pay Monthly is that any payment requests that take you over your arranged limit and your Â£50 buffer will normally be refused. However when payments are returned your credit rating may be affected.</p>
							<p>To help you manage your finances, we send text alerts the morning after your balance reaches 60%, 80% or 95% of your overdraft limit. We will send an unpaid text alert when we have made a decision not to pay a Direct Debit, Standing Order, future dated Bill Payment or Cheque due to there being insufficient available balance on your account. You then have until 3.30pm, on the day it is due to be paid, to pay in cleared funds and we will then make the payment. We also offer the Pay Monthly Money Calendar, a quick, interactive tool to help you take an objective look at your spending. Ever green trust co Bank  Account Pay Monthly is currently available for a fee of Â£10 a month.</p>
							<p>Representative Example: 19.9% EAR variable (assumed overdraft Â£1,200).</p>

								<h3>Our overdraft charges</h3>
								<p>The list below gives some examples of our charges when you make payments from your account when you do not have sufficient cleared funds and the payment would take you over any arranged overdraft. We developed these examples with leading consumer groups to help you to think about how changing the way you use your account can affect the amount we may charge you.</p>
								<p>These examples are meant to show how different actions can result in different charges. They are only examples so you shouldn't see them as actions you might take and charges you might have to pay.</p>
								<p>Please note, we may not allow you to use your account in the ways shown below. It is more cost effective if you avoid going over your arranged limit and you should contact us if you need help to manage your account or are struggling with your finances.</p>
